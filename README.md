The Only Rhino On The Earth
=============================
### Background :
In the future, as humans continue to get resources from the earth, and the earth gradually become barren, then the usable and survivable area become smaller and smaller. Therefore, in order to survive better, humans escape the earth and choose to live on other planets. They take away all the things that belonged to'them' and left this once beautiful home without looking back, but they left a rhino in the zoo.  
  
This rhino is old and walks on a fixed route every day, it was locked in this pink fence, and do not have enough strength to walk out of this solid fence. A corner of this originally prosperous zoo still retains its previous Wooden sign and sculptures, but the warning "please take care of them, or you will get hurt" has become a decoration, and no one will step into this land anymore. When there was a heavy snowfall in the sky, it was no longer known how long it had passed, and this place became the only place on the earth with a breath of life.
